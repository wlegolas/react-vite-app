# Application example using Vite

This project will be used to learn how can create a [React](https://reactjs.org/) application using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) Tooling.

Also I will use to improve my knowledge related to [React](https://reactjs.org/) and its ecosystem, for example, stack for test, state management, etc.

## Tech stack

- This project was bootstrapped with [Create Vite App](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project).
